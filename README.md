# ART151_GEN-DESIGN

  For this project my generative art focuses on the backround. The user
  can use their mouse to control how the draw is created my either moving
  their cursor up or down the screen or left or right. The fading background
  ultimately becomes the final product. I also use the concept of symmetry.
  The symmetry I used is embedded in the rings that make up the drawings. 
  As the user moves their mouse to create different types of ring configurations
  all the rings on the screen are also converted to the same configuration. 
  I have also included a directory with screenshots of some of the different images
  a user can create with my generative art program.
